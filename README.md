# 📝 Practice Tasks – Pandas & Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains two basic practice tasks focused on using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization.


##  Practice Task 1: Load, Clean, and Visualize Data

###  Objective
- Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Remove null values and duplicates
- Plot a bar graph based on the "Title" column

### 📁 File: `lead_titles_plot.ipynb`

#### 🧪 Steps Performed:
1. Loaded `leads_with_emails.csv` using `pd.read_csv()`
2. Removed missing and duplicate rows using `dropna()` and `drop_duplicates()`
3. Counted occurrences in the `'Title'` column
4. Visualized them using a **bar plot** with Matplotlib

## 📘 Practice Task 2: Jupyter Notebook Familiarity

###  Objective
- Practice creating and formatting a Jupyter Notebook
- Add Markdown cells, read CSV, and plot a graph

###  File: `jupyter_practice_task.ipynb`

####  Steps Performed:
1. Added a title and description using **Markdown**
2. Imported `pandas` and `matplotlib`
3. Read a CSV file
4. Plotted a basic graph (e.g., bar chart)
